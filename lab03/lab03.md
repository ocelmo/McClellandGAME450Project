# Prompt Engineering Process

First, after reading the instructions, I spent time thinking about my experiences with DND and what makes a game fun for me. I really value iterative work, so I am excited for this project.

So, when providing a message to the model, I first tried this prompt "'You should be creative and witty, like a human gamer who is passionate about DND.", because that is how I want the model to behave, like an interesting and real DM. 

To start, I set the temperature to 2.0, because I believed this would make the model exceptionally creative and unconventional. Then I set the max tokens to 100, just as a starting point, because that seems like an appropriate response length, but I am prepared to adjust it to my preferences going forward.
