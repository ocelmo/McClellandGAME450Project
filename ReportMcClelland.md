AI Technology Consultant - Final Project Report
GAME 450 - Spring 2025
Tori McClelland
Introduction: This report details my final project, the AI Technology Consultant. This agent acts as an information technology specialist, aiding students and faculty with everyday technological hangups. I would like to explain how I developed this Python script to make use of the AI methods that we learned in class. Additionally, I wish to outline the planning and rationale behind my development decisions to demonstrate how I’ve applied the course skills and my own innovations to create my helpful, well-functioning AI assistant system.


Base System Functionality
Interactive Troubleshooting - The AI can respond to user questions and provide advice, including step-by-step instructions on how to resolve issues.
The chatbot model can help with any device, including smartphones, laptops, desktops, and wifi routers.
The AI covers commonly encountered scenarios like blue error screens, inability to receive emails, printer disconnection, and slow speeds. But it is not limited to these situations!
The model starts with methodical and professional problem resolution. 
“My password isn’t working” is responded to with “Have you tried typing it in again?”
“Help me solve the paper jam in my HP Color Printer” is met with a 6 step plan to resolve the issue.
Password Strength Verification - As a cybersecurity specialist, the AI can analyze the strength of user passwords and offer feedback to improve them.
“Is my password weak, medium, or strong?”
“What can I add to my password to strengthen it?”
Advice on Best Practices - With knowledge from the Behrend IT Consultants handbook, the AI can offer informed advice about technology problems.
“Should I click on this suspicious email?”
“What should I do if I find a lost item in the computer lab?”
“How do I put new paper into the printer?”
“What are the campus help desk hours during the school year?”
Incident Ticket Tracking - As an IT consultant, the system will assign numerical values to interactions it has with users.
What is my ticket number? - The system can catalog issues and answer basic questions regarding which issue is being serviced.
Ticket numbers are chosen randomly out of hundreds of thousands, ensuring no 2 users receive the same value.
Step-by-Step Walkthroughs - The chatbot is capable of explaining steps to complete a task sequentially. This is especially helpful for kinetic learners who learn by doing.
“What are the steps I need to follow on my computer to install Adobe Premiere?”
“What commands do I need to enter into my terminal to install my program’s dependencies?”
“How do I disassemble and clean my OfficeJet Pro printer?”
 
Prompt Engineering and Model Parameter Choice
The system’s 3 agents each have a different role to play in the larger picture, each created to fill certain needs. As such, each agent has different parameters that reflect their desired capabilities.
General IT Consultant - The first agent is the default setting. This AI chat model is well-suited for general questions about devices and software. As I researched this project, I determined that emphasizing its personability and step-by-step logic to solve problems were the best aspects to include in this agent’s prompting. It uses its trained knowledge to answer questions in a structured and precise way. As such, it’s not very creative, having a temperature of 0.3. Additionally, I found it is most helpful when it keeps answers brief and concise, so through trial-and-error, I ended up setting the max tokens value lower and lower until deciding upon the value of 25. Lastly, I felt that in cases like these, where a user is solving a problem, it could be beneficial to have more than one path to follow. So, I adjusted the n parameter to 2. This means that the model will generate 2 text responses for every user input, providing greater opportunity for the user to receive a satisfactory response.


Technology/Cybersecurity Expert -  The second agent is a more knowledgeable and detailed version of the agent above, to be used in more complex technological situations. Since this agent deals with more nuanced situations, I allowed it to be more long-winded, giving it a max tokens parameter of 75. This creates longer, more descriptive responses that can aid the user in security issues. When considering a prompt, I ensured the agent understood it was operating at an “expert level” and that maintaining organizational security is its priority. Similarly, since I wanted the agent to think outside of the box and explore more possibilities, I increased the temperature to 0.6 so that less likely solutions could be chosen. However, this temperature is still relatively low because the information given still needs to be correct in general. Along with this, a frequency penalty parameter of 0.5 has been assigned. This input value encourages the model to choose more unique words instead of repeating phrases that have already been said. I find that this addition makes the model less redundant and more descriptive when it’s providing solutions.


Friendly Troubleshooting Assistant - The third agent is the most human and empathetic of all. This helper bot has been prompted to be emotive and highly responsive. I was careful to craft the prompt in such a way that the AI’s mission was still clear, while maintaining a sense of human honesty and integrity. Due to its higher creativity, a temperature of 0.9, the model can offer more personalized advice when walking a user through a problem. This model doesn’t need responses quite as long as the more technical agent, but it goes into greater detail than the default agent, so I found that a middleground of 50 tokens yielded responses of appropriate length. Along those lines, I wanted this agent to be a comprehensive and viable option for a user, like a student or professor, struggling with everyday problems, like connecting to the school's Wi-Fi, so I wanted this agent to have a good memory of chats. 
Tools Usage
A relevant tool I created for this IT Consultant project is a ticket number generator. Typically, in a customer service environment, customers are assigned ticket numbers to keep track of their interactions and incidents. To emulate this in my model, I created a Python script tool that generates a new random ticket number. This ticketing system helps users refer back to their technology requests.
To build this tool, it was important to identify what Python libraries were needed to accomplish the pseudo-random number generation. For this need, I utilized the random library and integrated its functions into my Python IDE.
Another innovative tool I developed for my IT agent is the password checker. This tool uses simple logic to verify a user’s password strength. The AI can provide feedback on how secure the user’s current password is and offer suggestions that can be used to buff up the password. The ability to invoke this tool gives users greater peace of mind.
To develop this tool, I installed the Python passlib library for its built-in password checking features. The included functions judge a password based on entropy, the unpredictability of a given string. However, after some research, I found that this library no longer offered this ability. So, I created my own script to perform the same functions. I felt like this was the best choice for the needs of my project because a more unguessable password means the user will feel more secure. Now the code will prompt a user for their password, calculate the entropy, and return the results, all modeled after the passlib old system.


Planning & Reasoning
The AI Technology Consultant was developed with user experience in mind. I found that the best way to create a responsive and accurate model was to implement chain-of-thought thinking in my prompts and scripts. We saw in class what a great difference in quality that chain-of-thought modelling makes in a language model environment. All 3 of the specialized agents follow some form of step-by-step logic, enhancing their overall coherence and user experience. Because of this, I would like to outline the planning and reasoning concepts I have integrated into my AI Technology Consultant system.
Firstly, Chain-of-thought reasoning is used by the default agent, the General IT Consultant, to break down complex questions into small steps. For example, a user might wonder how to print a document from his phone. Because of the way it is prompted, the model will then enter a reasoning process. The chatbot will offer steps such as “go to the printing website” and “select a document to print.” In this fashion, each step builds on the previous one, ensuring that the user can understand each stage in the process.
Next, the Technology/Cybersecurity Expert applies similar reasoning to take care of security risks. For instance, if users want to identify an email as spam or legitimate, the AI assistant will go through sequential steps to check for signs of phishing and advise the user on how to handle the email. Because of these thoughtful action steps, the users can learn what spam emails look like, to better prepare them in the future.
Lastly, the Friendly Troubleshooting Assistant uses its chain-of-thought logic to take a conversational approach in solving an everyday IT concern. A great example of how this logic plays out is during a paper jam. One student is unable to print his report. After asking the model for help, he will receive a response of a few steps: “check that the printer is plugged in and turned on”, “identify error messages on the screen”, and so on. The user feels reassured having a simple path to follow. Since each step is explicitly spelled out, there is little room for error and, therefore, high user satisfaction.


RAG Implementation
	This IT Consultant system is modeled after the Behrend IT Desk here on campus, and as such, its primary resource is the Behrend Student IT Consultant Handbook. I provided the agents with this handbook, a primary resource, to allow the AI to have greater context. This increases the model’s awareness of situations because it can retrieve relevant information from the file. This approach is beneficial since the system can maintain a sort of “lore”, or context, while delivering its responses.
	For example, a user could inquire about what services the IT Consultant provides. In this case, the AI will reference the handbook’s section on services and consultant duties in order to answer the questions. Since the responses are influenced directly by the provided material, they are bound to be more accurate and applicable to the needs of users.

Additional Tools / Innovation
		The additional tool I added to the project is text-to-speech. Specifically, I integrated the pyttsx3 AI model from HuggingFace into my project. This add-on allows the IT Consultant to respond audibly, improving the user experience of the system. This feature has applications for blind and visually impaired users, as they can hear the responses instead of needing to read off a screen. Additionally, this feature benefits users who prefer to learn through audio. The auditory interaction may be a preferred IT experience for some users, especially those who are accustomed to traditional, in-person IT help desks.
	This specific AI model was chosen due to its exceptional abilities as an assistant-type agent, like the one used in this project. The pyttsx3 is known for maintaining a sense of identity even when speaking in varied styles and tones. Therefore, this high-quality model is perfect for delivering professional and confident IT advice.

Code Quality & Modular Design
	This class has taught me the beauty and simplicity of Python, so I was sure to follow best coding practices. To name a few, I made sure my code was readable and easy to understand, with descriptive and consistent variable names as well as structured indentation. Nextly, I used comments inside my scripts to ensure they are well-documented. This creates code that can be understood by other developers.
	The system is designed in a modular fashion, meaning the architecture is divided into reusable components that are separate from one another. To begin, there is the logic for each of the 3 agents. Each agent has a unique configuration, but the code for all agents is grouped together. However, each agent is independently testable, maintaining good distinction. Then, the 
Tools like the password-checker are encapsulated and divided into their own functions, so that the code can be accessed by all the agents across all different technology scenarios. This will make updating the model in the future very easy, as new tools can be integrated seamlessly with the structure that is set in place. After these parts, there is the RAG component. The necessary data is loaded and processed in such a way that it is not dependent on the other modules of code, and can thus be tested individually. Of course, then there is the text-to-speech integration, standing out as another distinct part. This separation allows for a new model to be easily swapped into its place, if a change ever needs to take place. Finally, the main chatting loop is separated from all other systems, meaning that changes to the tools, RAG, etc., will not impact the core conversation ability.
	Regarding version control, I was happy to get more comfortable with GitHub during this course. I learned that it is best to commit early and often when working on a large project. This class also taught me how to leave meaningful commit messages, the short descriptions of my changes, as I pushed new code to the repository. I made sure to use these best practices and more in alignment with the class’s learning objectives.
